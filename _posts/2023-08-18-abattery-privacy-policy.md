# Privacy Policy

#### Last update: 2025-10-09

Shen Lin built the **aBattery** app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Shen Lin at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use my Service.

By using this Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. Any information collected is used solely to provide and improve the Service. I do not personally collect or process user data beyond what is handled automatically by third-party services integrated in the app.

## Information Collection and Use

The app integrates third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These services are provided by Google and operate under their respective privacy policies.

**Third-party services used by the app include:**

- [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
- [Google AdMob](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
- [Google User Messaging Platform (UMP)](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/user-messaging-platform/)

**Purpose of use:**

- **Google AdMob** is used to display ads within the app. Advertising data such as your device’s advertising ID may be processed by Google to provide personalized or non-personalized ads according to your consent.
- **Google User Messaging Platform (UMP)** is used to obtain and manage user consent regarding data usage and advertising in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.

All data collection and processing for advertising and analytics are handled directly by Google under their own privacy terms. I do not have access to, nor do I store, transmit, or share any personal data of users.

## GDPR and EU Representative

This app is developed and maintained by an independent developer based in Hong Kong.  
I do not directly process or store any personal data of users in the European Union. All data handling related to advertising or analytics is conducted by Google, as the data controller, under its own GDPR-compliant framework.

Based on the nature of the app and the fact that I do not independently determine or process user data from the EU, I believe the appointment of an EU representative under Article 27 of the GDPR is **not required**.  
However, users in the EU may contact me directly if they have any data protection inquiries regarding the app.

## Log Data

In case of an error, the app may collect log data (through third-party tools) such as your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, time and date of use, and other statistics. This information is used only for debugging and improving the app experience.

---

## Cookies

This app does not explicitly use cookies. However, third-party services integrated in the app (such as Google AdMob) may use cookies or similar technologies to serve ads and improve their services. You can manage your cookie preferences through the consent dialog shown by Google UMP.

---

## Children’s Privacy

This service is available to children of all ages with no special restrictions.

---

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This policy may be updated periodically. You are advised to review this page for changes. Updates will be posted on this page with the effective date.

**Effective date:** 2025-10-09
